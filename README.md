# NeuralN
This is my first Repository <br> <br>
1. Design of a small CNN using Pytorch for MNIST handwritten digit image classification. Trained it on the training set for 50 epochs and reporting the accuracy on the test set after 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 epochs.<br><br>
2. Creating an Image using Numpy and editing it <br><br>
3. Reading an Image from the local systerm and making changes and playing with it (editing the colors, dimensions).
